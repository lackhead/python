# python
A place to keep Python code not for a specific project (learning, experimentation, etc)

## local_conn.py

My first Python script ever! I wrote this as a solution to one of the challenges 
from the [September 2017 py-study-group challenge](https://github.com/py-study-group/challenges/blob/master/September/challenges4.md). The text is as follows: 
> Use Python to see who is connected your network
> Get the local IP address and subnet mask and calculate the address range in you network segment. Scan all the addresses and display those that are alive.
> Bonus Points: Extract the IPs on a CSV file
